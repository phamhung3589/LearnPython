# Python program to find nth magic number: a number which can be expressed as a power of 5 or sum of unique powers of 5
# Ex: 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.
# magic numbers can be represented as 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110

        p = p*5

        # If last bit of n is set
        if n & 1:
            result += p

        # proceed to next bit ir b = n//2
        n = n>>1
